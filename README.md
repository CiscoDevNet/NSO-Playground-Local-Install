# NSO Playground - Local Install

[![Run in Cisco Cloud IDE](https://static.production.devnetcloud.com/codeexchange/assets/images/devnet-runable-icon.svg)](https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/devenv/CiscoDevNet/NSO-Playground-Local-Install)

Explore and experiment with the world of NSO on Cisco Code Exchange, where you can dive right in and try out examples in a user-friendly browser-based integrated development environment (IDE).

But wait, there's more! You can also contribute your examples and share them with everyone. The best part is your peers can play with your examples without installing anything.

If you are new to NSO, start with [NSO learning labs](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/search/?contentType=track,module,lab&keyword=nso&sortBy=luceneScore) where you will find step by step guides prepared by Cisco.

## How can I add my own example?

1. Simply submit your repo on <https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/submit/>
2. Once your submission is approved, your repository will be featured on the [Cisco Cloud IDE](https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/search/?complexity=devenv)
3. That's it! Now you can start exploring, playing, and sharing your awesome examples. Let the creativity flow!

## Need an example?

Try the example below to get familiar with the Cloud IDE Environment. Copy or type the commands below into the **VS Code terminal.**

This short example will demonstrate how to set up a simulated network of Cisco IOS routers and manage these with NSO in Code Exchange Cloud IDE. NSO will talk Cisco CLI towards the routers.

> If you want to see a detailed explanation of the commands below see [NSO Intro Learning Lab](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/labs/nso-intro/introduction/)

1. Prepare NSO

   ```bash
   source $NCS_DIR/ncsrc
   ncs-netsim --dir ~/example/netsim create-network cisco-ios-cli-3.8 2 ios
   ncs-setup --dest ~/example --netsim-dir ~/example/netsim
   ```

2. Start netsim

   ```bash
   cd ~/example/
   ncs-netsim start
   ```

3. Start NSO

   ```bash
   ncs
   ```

4. Review NSO status

   ```bash
   ncs --version
   ncs --status | grep -i status
   ```

5. Enter NSO and learn the configuration of `ios0`.

   ```bash
   ncs_cli -C -u admin
   devices sync-from
   ```

6. See the configuration of `ios0` and change the hostname.

   ```bash
   config
   show full-configuration devices device ios1 config | nomore
   devices device ios0 config
   ios:hostname nso.cisco.com
   ```

7. Finally see what NSO will send to the device and commit the changes.

   ```bash
   top
   commit dry-run outformat native
   commit
   ```

Go to `$NCS_DIR` > `examples.ncs` in the VS Code workspace or use the terminal

```bash
cd $NCS_DIR/examples.ncs/

## Guidelines

- Code shared is public, **avoid any confidential information.**

## Recommendations

- It is recommended to avoid specifying NSO versions in the code, as the underlying NSO will be upgraded with newer releases.
- As seen in the examples use environment variables when developing.
  - `$NCS_DIR` is a handy environment variable.
  - Use `env | grep -i ncs` to see the environment variables available by `ncs`.
- The directory structure of the workspace matters, consider it when creating an example.
- Use the **preview** feature (right click) in VS Code to the see the markdown files formatted.

## FAQ

- What NEDs come with the container?

  - Example NEDs. These should be considered as examples. NEDs in the container are only used to run the simulated networks. Do not use these with real devices.

    ```bash
    developer:~ > ls -1 $NCS_DIR/packages/neds/
    a10-acos-cli-3.0
    alu-sr-cli-3.4
    cisco-asa-cli-6.6
    cisco-ios-cli-3.0
    cisco-ios-cli-3.8
    cisco-iosxr-cli-3.0
    cisco-iosxr-cli-3.5
    cisco-nx-cli-3.0
    dell-ftos-cli-3.0
    juniper-junos-nc-3.0
    developer:~ > ls -1 $NCS_DIR/packages/neds/ | wc -l
    10
    developer:~ >
    ```

- My code is approved, but I don't see it?
  - Expand the `/home/developer/src` in the workspace
  - or do `ls -l /home/developer/src`
